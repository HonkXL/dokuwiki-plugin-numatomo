# DokuWiki Plugin Matomo
DokuWiki integration for Matomo web analytics software (formerly "Piwik")

This is a simple integration plugin that allows you to use the [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) web analytics software (formerly known as "Piwik") with DokuWiki.

Note that this does not come with the actual Matomo server. You need to either set up your own, or use a shared (possibly commercial) instance. However, because the server requirements for Matomo are very similar to that of DokuWiki (plus a database server), this should be easy to do for most DokuWiki admins.

More information coming soon.
